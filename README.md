Kanzu Support Desk
==================

Kanzu Support Desk (KSD) is a simple helpdesk solution that keeps your customer interactions fast & personal.

##Description 

Great customer care is at the heart of every good product or service. Kanzu Support Desk simplifies the process of tracking customer requests, grouping them, assigning them and giving prompt
feedback, all with a personal touch. KSD fits into your native WordPress interface like a hand in a snug glove so that you can get to do a lot intuitively.

KSD allows you to:

* Use a very simple, native WordPress interface
* Receive email notifications to keep you and your happy customer up-to-date on a ticket's progress
* Work seamlessly with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads
* Have multiple channels for ticket-creation. You can use a support form on the front-end of your site or a form in your admin panel. Using one of [our premium addons](https://kanzucode.com/downloads/category/kanzu-support-desk/), you can also enable support for tickets created by [email](https://kanzucode.com/downloads/kanzu-support-desk-mail/), [Facebook](https://kanzucode.com/downloads/kanzu-support-desk-facebook/) or [Twitter](https://kanzucode.com/downloads/kanzu-support-desk-twitter/). 
* Have as many agents as you want
* Track changes to a ticket from a ticket log
* Monitor your performance from beautiful graphs on your dashboard
* Create private notes on tickets to allow agents share extra information on tickets with each other
* Re-assign tickets in a jiffy
* Group tickets based on products/categories/tags/departments - whatever works for you 
* Change to a language you prefer since the plugin supports translation. You can [contribute to translations here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/kanzu-support-desk)


##Installation 

# Using The WordPress Dashboard #

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'kanzu-support-desk'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

# Uploading in WordPress Dashboard #

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
3. Select `kanzu-support-desk.zip` from your computer
4. Click 'Install Now'
5. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

# Using FTP #

1. Download `kanzu-support-desk.zip`
2. Extract the `kanzu-support-desk` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `kanzu-support-desk` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

## After activation ##
You'll get an intro message and walk through an quick tour of the plugin. You'll create your first ticket and see how to send a reply and make changes to it.

At installation, two pages are created automatically:

1. Submit Ticket    - Has a support form for customers to submit tickets
2. My Tickets       - Shows a customer's tickets after they log in. They'll track ticket progress here

## Support Forms ##
In case you'd like to have extra support forms, use shortcode [ksd_support_form] to create a support form anywhere. Alternatively, use the support form widget
If you'd like customers to be able to use a support form tucked away in the bottom right of every page on your site, enable the "Show support button" option in your KSD settings.

You can also get our [Mail add-on](https://kanzucode.com/downloads/kanzu-support-desk-mail) to allow your customers create tickets by emailing your support email address.

Adding CAPTCHA inputs to a form is a good way to prevent spam. To add CAPTCHA to your support form, go [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin), get Google reCAPTCHA keys and then add them to your KSD settings.

Please check out [our documentation here](https://kanzucode.com/kb_topic/kb-kanzu-support-desk/) for a more detailed walk-through should you need it
